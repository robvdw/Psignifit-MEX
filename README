Make sure you replace in PSYGNIFIT.c 

in for example 

/Volumes/RESTORE_BACKUP/PARALLELS_9/RIPPLE_2009/MANUS_2009/DATA_ANALYSIS/RippleData/psignifit/psig-src
if(index < 0.0 || index > (double)(nVals - 1.0)) return NAN;
to:
if(isnan(index) || index < 0.0 || index > (double)(nVals - 1.0)) return NAN;

WHEN mex.h CANNOT BE FOUD DO the FOLLOWING

copy  (without replacing!)

dylib library files 
from 
/Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v714/bin/maci64/

to (ACTUAL MATLAB PACKAGE):

/Applications/MATLAB_R2010b.app/bin/maci64


ALSO COPY all files from directories (include  AND lib) in 

/Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v714/extern

TO 

/Applications/MATLAB_R2010b.app/extern




Make sure to use a clean psygnifit DIRECTORY!
